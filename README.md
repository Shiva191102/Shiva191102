Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on AI/ML projects, Generative AI, Full-Stack Web Development.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced AI/ML techniques and MLOps for scalable deployments

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on end-to-end AI/ML solutions, MLOps pipelines, and scalable cloud-based AI applications

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with optimizing ML models for production, automating MLOps workflows, and building scalable AI architectures

âš¡ Fun fact: I transitioned from a Mechanical Engineer to a full-time AI/ML, DevOps, and software engineering career!
